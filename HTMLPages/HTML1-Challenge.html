<p>A web designer is an indivisula that amkes their living by designing and maintaining web sites. This is a field that has evolved extremeleyy quickly over the past decade, but thr fundamental still temains the same. Anr web designer must have a strong understanding of the HTML language. Contrary to what most people believe HTML is not a programming language, but a formatting language developed by <strong>Tim Burners-Lee</strong> in 1989. Since its original development HTML has come a long way and has incorporated a multitude of new features. HTML allowed for the development of the World Wide Web and the explosive popularity of the internet !</p>    
    
<p>As HTML evolved, developers soon realized that the structure of web pages should be defined used HTML and the page style, look and feel, should be defined separately, thuus the birth cascading style sheets. Now developers use HTML to define what the information on the web page is, such as a heading content, article, content, a paragrapg within the article, or the footer content, etc. Cascading sheetswere designed to define the color of documents, the size, margins, colors, and positioning of the various elements of the page.  </p>    
    
<p>About the time the HTML and the World Wide Web were hitting the public sector, PHP waas being developed to make the web pages a more powerful tool. PHP is a scripting language that is written directly on the web page and interpreted by the web server which ould send the final version of the web page to the visitor browser. About a year later, <strong>Netscape</strong> realesed the frist verson of JavaScripth, inder the name Mocha wehich later became LiveScript, and then JavaSrcipt. Javascript is also a scripting language, but unlike PHP, JavaScript is interpreted by the visitors browser rather than the web server. As a result JavaScript is not as powerful as PHP and lacks the ability to interact with a database, but still provides processing functionally to a web page. Web page designers now days must not only be proficient in HTML and CSS, but a variety of scripting language as well. Even though HTML was the first language of the web, many more have come along, but it still remains the fundemental structure that the web page is built from.</p>
