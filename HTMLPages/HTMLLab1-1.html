      <p>When you view a web page in your browser, you are seeing the interpreted code that you type into your text editor. Web pages are made up of text which is called "Marked Up", or formatted using Hyper Text Markup Language or HTML. the HTML codes, lnown as tags, are placed around the text that you want to format> in most cases, when formating text, you will have both an openning tag and closing tag to indicate where the formating should start and where it should end. </p> 
        
     <p>Content on a web page is contained inside elements.There are basically two types of elements, block and inline. This content is being written inside a paragrapgh element, which is a block element because there will be a space above and below the paragraph essentially blocking it off from other content.<strong>However this content is in a strong element which is inline. Iniline elements do not seperate their content</strong>. Block elements will effect a page layout, where inline elmenents will not. </p>
    
      <p>There are all different types of elements that go  make up a web page. The element used on this page is the HTML, which is also called the element root, the head ekement, bosy element, heading element, paragragh element, and the stronng inline element. the element used on this page, other than the strong element, are the minimum that any web page should include. In the next lab you will include somw of the other elements uses to organize content on a web page.</p>
